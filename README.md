Hi, I'm Delphine aka Orca, a student at 42 Perpignan 👾. I’m currently learning C, and it's just the beginning of my tech journey.
Having lived in different countries and experienced diverse cultures, I’ve developed a passion for discovering new activities, from knitting to climbing.
I find joy in these moments and in connecting with people. Recently, I've also set my sights on learning to play the piano.

I’m excited to share my growth and adventures in tech!✨

Hi, I'm Delphine aka Orca, a student at 42 Perpignan 👾. I started my tech journey with C and am now diving into the world of **C++**. I'm actively building a strong foundation for my future in software development.

I am currently seeking an **internship in Data Analysis**. I'm passionate about leveraging code to explore and derive meaningful insights from data.

Having lived in different countries and experienced diverse cultures, I've developed a deep appreciation for the **simple joys of daily life**. I find happiness in these *'petites choses du quotidien'*, like enjoying a great cup of coffee at X Café, spending a night stargazing with friends, or going to the theatre. These moments of connection and presence are where true happiness is built.

I’m excited to share my growth, adventures in tech, and future projects!✨
