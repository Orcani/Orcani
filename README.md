Hi, I'm Delphine aka Orca, a student at 42 Perpignan ðŸ‘¾. Iâ€™m currently learning C, and it's just the beginning of my tech journey.
Having lived in different countries and experienced diverse cultures, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for discovering new activities, from knitting to climbing.
I find joy in these moments and in connecting with people. Recently, I've also set my sights on learning to play the piano.

Iâ€™m excited to share my growth and adventures in tech!âœ¨
